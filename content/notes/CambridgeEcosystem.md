# Why It Matters

Education has changed. Tools like Google and ChatGPT reduce the need to memorise or manually analyse data. Today, the focus is **learning how to create value using modern tools**, and entrepreneurship societies are at the forefront of this shift.

Most university societies are administrative - secretaries schedule meetings, treasurers manage accounts, and presidents/VPs oversee activities - often serving as a CV boost for consulting or finance careers. In contrast, **enterprise and innovation societies** go beyond admin tasks, offering opportunities to **build real-world skills, start ventures, and gain insights that extend far beyond university**. Entrepreneurship isn’t just for business students, as anyone can be a problem-solver.

# How to navigate the ecosystem

Cambridge has a **decentralised entrepreneurial ecosystem**, spanning societies, startup competitions, incubators, and external organisations, overseen by Cambridge Enterprise. Read through the [**IE Cambridge support guide (!!)**](/notes/SupportGuide.pdf) made by Cambridge Enterprise to take a look at the 100+ organisations involved, and take note of those in the space you’re interested in. You can also look at the [**IE Cambridge innovation report**](/notes/InnovationReport.pdf) as well.

As an executive member of Cambridge University Entreprenurs [(CUE)](https://www.cambridgeuniversityentrepreneurs.com/) and Cambridge University Technology and Enterprise Club [(CUTEC)](https://www.cutec.io/), I still find myself learning new things, so don’t be afraid if it seems overwhelming at first sight!

**Advice to get started:**

- Attend in-person and online events to network and discuss ideas. Make sure to join WhatsApp/Slack groups where much of the information is shared
- Join startup incubators (e.g. [Kings Elab](https://www.kingselab.org/), [Accelerate](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/accelerate-cambridge/)) or competitions (e.g. [Oxbridge AI Challenge](https://www.oxbridgeaix.uk/), [Trinity Bradford Prize](https://www.trinitybradfieldprize.co.uk/), college-specific ones like [Fitzelerate](https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/fitzelerate))
- Consider joining society committees to lead events and meet like-minded people

**Example organisations by focus:**

- **Healthtech:** [MedTech Foundation](https://cam.medtechfoundation.org/), [Building Bridges in Medical Science (BBMS)](https://www.bbms.cam/), [AI in Medicine](https://www.cuaim.co.uk/)
- **PhD research spin-outs:** [Biospark](https://www.gravity.cam.ac.uk/bio-spark/), [Maxwell Impulse Programme](https://www.maxwell.cam.ac.uk/programmes/impulse)

# Final remarks

Cambridge isn’t just about academic research - it’s the **second-highest unicorns per capita** globally, with investment growing rapidly. Over the coming decades, the university will increasingly position **entrepreneurship as a core part of education**.
