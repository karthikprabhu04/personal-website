Of all computer science courses, [**Harvard’s CS50x**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) has always seemed to be the gold standard for understanding what’s *really* happening under the hood.

Why does that matter? As **AI and software redefine every industry**, anyone who wants to shape the future needs to think beyond using tools - and start understanding the *systems* behind them. CS50x forces you to do exactly that with their lectures, sections, shorts and problem sets.

The course spans around 11 weeks (10–20 hours per week). I went through one week per day through deep focus until Week 5 - when **Data Structures** slowed me down - then completed the rest alongside other courses and wrapped up with the **Final Project** later.

What makes CS50x unique is its **hands-on design**. It provides a dedicated coding environment with manuals, correctness checkers (`check50`), and even an AI assistant (*CS50 Duck*). These “training wheels” gradually come off as the course progresses, helping you build actual independence as a programmer.

# Key Concepts by Week

**Week 0 - Scratch:** A visual reintroduction to programming logic, binary, ASCII, and pseudocode - a reminder of how much we take for granted once we start coding.

**Week 1 - C:** Quite a jump from Scratch into low-level programming. You learn how source code compiles to machine code and why correctness, design, and style matter.

**Week 2 - Arrays:** Builds on C, introducing arrays, memory allocation, debugging, and how data is represented in memory.

**Week 3 - Algorithms:** Covers core search and sort algorithms, Big O notation, and recursion - the foundation of computational efficiency.

**Week 4 - Memory:** I found this one of the toughest but most eye-opening weeks. You explore pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and why understanding these concepts prevents real-world system failures (like the CrowdStrike case).

**Week 5 - Data Structures:** Introduces queues, stacks, linked lists, trees, hash tables, and time complexity - the architecture of software.

**Week 6 - Python:** A relief after C. You move into a higher-level language, seeing how abstraction makes development faster but less transparent.

**Week 7 - SQL:** Teaches database management - from relationships and joins to race conditions and SQL injections.

**Week 8 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Introduces web programming and internet infrastructure to see how everything really works - DNS, HTTP, ports, and developer tools.

**Week 9 - Flask:** A gateway to full-stack development. This section teaches you to build web apps using Flask, APIs, and JSON, guided by the MVC framework.

**Week 10 - Final Project:** A synthesis of everything learned. My final project was an [**AI-powered lecture summariser**](https://github.com/karthikprabhu04/harvard-cs50x-final-project) - open-source, private (runs locally), and slower as a trade-off for data privacy.


## Final Remarks

CS50x is challenging, but deeply rewarding. It’s less about memorising syntax and more about **learning how to think** - a skill that transcends computer science.

To play devil’s advocate and find a critque, it doesn’t teach full-stack or AI integration in depth, though this is not its goal. Its purpose is to build **foundational understanding** - the type that lets you see how everything in software fits together, a “systems thinking”.

If AI gives everyone new tools, **CS50x gives you the blueprint** to maximise your utility of these tools.
