# My Experience in the MedTech Foundation Innovation Programme

After attending several MedTech and biotech conferences, hackathons, and workshops, I came to realise that truly understanding the field requires going beyond surface-level exposure - it means going deep into a specific clinical problem and exploring how technology can solve it.

To gain that experience, I applied to the [Cambridge MedTech Foundation Innovation Programme](https://cam.medtechfoundation.org/ip/) — a four-month educational initiative that introduces students to the landscape of medical device development with mentorship and workshops.

At the start of the programme, we were presented with a series of real-world clinical challenges from practising clinicians, each with rich context and unmet needs. Our options included:
* **CSF diagnostics**: designing low-cost, portable tools to improve access and accelerate diagnosis of meningitis in resource-limited settings
* **Intraoperative neuronavigation tools**: developing affordable technology to help surgeons navigate the brain safely and accurately during surgery
* **Cannulation**: creating point-of-care guidance systems to improve success rates in cannulation procedures

I chose to work on the CSF diagnostics project, and was placed in a multidisciplinary team combining expertise from medicine, engineering, and business. With support from our facilitator and clinical, technical, and business mentors, we were given the freedom to define our own approach to tackling the problem - an experience that was both challenging and immensely rewarding.

# A Four-Month Journey

We began the project by establishing a team working contract, defining our roles and expectations for effective collaboration by reducing task conflicts. From there, we progressed through a structured sequence of workshops that supported us as we developed our project deliverables - starting with an abstract outlining our proposed solution, followed by a 1500-word executive summary, and finally a pitch deck presented to a panel of judges.

Over the course of four months, we took part in a comprehensive programme of workshops, mentorship, and milestone submissions that guided us through every stage of the MedTech innovation process. Each session added a new layer of insight - from identifying clinical needs and designing solutions, to evaluating feasibility and building a viable business case.

### Workshop 1: Opportunity Evaluation
Led by Andrew Hatcher from the Judge Business School, this session taught us how to identify and evaluate unmet clinical needs, assess feasibility, and define value propositions - essentially the foundation of innovation in healthcare.

### Workshop 2: Concept Generation
We learned about how ideas evolve within real clinical environments. Clinical Engineering Innovation at Cambridge University Hospitals and Professor Andrew Grace shared how unmet needs become viable projects through interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Workshop 3: Business Model Canvas
Returning again, Andrew Hatcher introduced the Business Model Canvas — a strategic tool that helped us visualise how our idea could sustain itself commercially while maintaining clinical value.

### Workshop 4: From Concept to Product
This session delved into regulatory strategy, prototyping, and intellectual property. Talks from Dr Anita Marguerie de Rotrou (Office for Translational Research), Team Consulting, and Anna Davies (Cambridge Enterprise) helped us understand the real-world pathway from idea to approved medical device.

### Workshop 5: How to Pitch
The final session with Simon Hall, communication expert and course leader at the University of Cambridge, taught us how to present complex technical concepts clearly and persuasively — a crucial skill for pitching innovations to investors and stakeholders.

# Mentorship and Deliverables

Throughout the programme, our progress was supported by mentors from clinical, technical, and business backgrounds. Their insights were invaluable in helping us refine our device concept and ensure it addressed a genuine clinical need. We produced a working contract, abstract, executive summary, and a pitch deck, which we presented to a panel of judges within Cambridge’s innovation ecosystem. Our mentors included:
* Dr Sara Venturini – Clinical Mentor, who guided us in refining the medical relevance and diagnostic feasibility of our device.
*  Richard Armstrong-Wood – Technical Mentor, who advised on engineering design, functionality, and practical implementation.
* Harry Bullimore (Vox) – Business Mentor, who helped us strengthen our commercial strategy and understand market positioning.
* Vic Xiao – Team Facilitator, who ensured our workflow remained focused, collaborative, and well-structured.

The pitch presentation was a particularly rewarding experience - an opportunity to bring together everything we’d learned and communicate our concept to experts in MedTech, entrepreneurship, and healthcare innovation.

# Reflections

At first, I expected the programme to provide a general overview of MedTech - but it turned out to be far more useful. It offered a clear framework for how healthcare innovations are conceived, validated, and developed, showing me how to bridge the gap between clinical practice and product design through collaboration between medicine, engineering, and business.

It also gave me a deeper appreciation for how clinical insight becomes scalable innovation when design, regulation, and business strategy align. More than anything, it taught me that meaningful innovation isn’t just about new technology - it’s about creating change that truly improves patient care.
