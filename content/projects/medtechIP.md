## The MedTech Innovation Programme

As part of the Innovation Programme 2024/25, we aim to design a low-cost, bedside diagnostic solution for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. This device will improve accessibility, speed, and accuracy of CSF testing, enhancing patient care, especially in resource-limited settings.
