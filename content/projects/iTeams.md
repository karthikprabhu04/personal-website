# What is i-Teams?

[**i-Teams**](https://iteamsonline.org/) is a Cambridge consulting program where interdisciplinary teams of 7 (Master’s, PhDs, post-docs, MBAs, etc.) develop commercially viable strategies for emerging technologies. Over 6 weeks, you work directly with inventors and mentors through lectures and workshops, building practical skills in market research, strategy, and pitching.

Though not as well-known as student-run groups (e.g. Cambridge Consulting Network), i-Teams stands out because it’s **run by the university** and offers direct collaboration with inventors. Sessions take place at the [Institute for Manufacturing (IfM)](https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/) which can be quite far, though online attendance is possible.

# Our project

As part of [**Development i-Teams**](https://iteamsonline.org/development-i-teams/), I worked with mentor [**Clara Aranda-Jan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claraaranda/) and inventor [**Louise Allen**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-allen-383466142/) on:

- [**DigiVis**](https://www.digivis.uk/) – clinically approved vision assessment technology
- [**DigiBel**](https://cobaltgrid.com/project/digibel/) – clinically approved hearing assessment technology

Our goal was to identify industries where these tools could generate revenue for future development. We explored applications across the NHS, schools, and opticians (e.g. Boots).

Workshops covered design thinking, market selection, and international development in collaboration with the [**Centre for Global Equality**](https://centreforglobalequality.org/). We interviewed UK and international experts, synthesised findings, and presented our recommendations to Cambridge Enterprise and industry experts. (Details can’t be shared due to NDA.)

# Final remarks

If you’re interested in consulting, i-Teams is one of the best opportunities in Cambridge. Choose a project aligned with your interests (e.g. healthtech) and you’ll gain skills and experience that go well beyond the program.
