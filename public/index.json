While it’s a vast field, the answer turned out simple: build things and learn along the way. It’s the most effective way to ensure what you’re learning is relevant and practical. However, there are some extremely useful courses to help you stay on track.\nGenerally there are 3 main routes to learn software engineering:\nDescription Pros Cons Computer science degree 3-4 year university program Credibility which opens research/advanced roles Expensive and time-consuming, Less practical coding experience Coding Bootcamp 3-6 month intensive, project-based coding course Fast and practical, More career-focused Expensive, Narrow scope Self-learning Learn via online courses and projects Flexible and low-cost, Independence allows personalised learning Can get overwhelmed with resources, No formal credential, Requires discipline It’s quite difficult for an institution to teach a subject that will completely change by the time of graduation, and coding bootmaps don’t fare much better. Either way, you’ll have to be a self-learner. The rest of this article outlines some of the resources I found quite helpful. These are all open-source (free) and are maintained to a high level.\nHarvard CS50x (Fundamentals) I started with Harvard CS50x, completing the 11-week course in 2 weeks by 2x lecture speed and going through problem sets late into the night. It’s quite difficult but perfect for programming fundamentals. I followed it up with CS50P (Python) and CS50W (Web development). However, while good for fundamentals, it doesn’t teach the systems thinking needed to build scalable solutions.\nThe Odin Project (Fullstack) Regarding open-source fullstack courses, there seems to be 3 main options\nFreeCodeCamp: good for practice, but too hand-holdy and outdated. Full Stack Open: solid content, but a steep start and clunky UI. The Odin Project (TOP): clear, project-based, structured — the best fit. I started TOP after CS50, finishing the foundations in a week and started posting daily progress on my X/Twitter to stay accountable. I chose the JavaScript pathway over Ruby for its versatility, strong community, and relevance to healthtech. NB you don’t need to install Linux on windows, you can just run everything on VScode, so feel free to skip this part of the setup process.\nKaggle (AI/ML) There seems to be an ever increasing amount of AI/ML courses. Rather than learning the PhD-level maths to build foundational models and will probably change by the time you learn it, it seems more practical to focus on implementing AI using existing tools since much of the maths is done by libraries made for you (e.g. PyTorch). Kaggle is really good for a project-based framework to teach you the key concepts only.\nFinal remarks The most important step is to start. Decide where you want to go, then reverse-engineer a path and choose the best resources. Courses can guide you, but real progress comes from taking action and iterating as you learn.\n","permalink":"http://karthikprabhu.me/notes/swe/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI went through countless articles and videos looking for the best way to learn software engineering.

Tools like Google and ChatGPT reduce the need to memorise or manually analyse data. Today, the focus is learning how to create value using modern tools, and entrepreneurship societies are at the forefront of this shift.\nMost university societies are administrative - secretaries schedule meetings, treasurers manage accounts, and presidents/VPs oversee activities - often serving as a CV boost for consulting or finance careers. In contrast, enterprise and innovation societies go beyond admin tasks, offering opportunities to build real-world skills, start ventures, and gain insights that extend far beyond university. Entrepreneurship isn’t just for business students, as anyone can be a problem-solver.\nHow to navigate the ecosystem Cambridge has a decentralised entrepreneurial ecosystem, spanning societies, startup competitions, incubators, and external organisations, overseen by Cambridge Enterprise. Read through the IE Cambridge support guide (!!) made by Cambridge Enterprise to take a look at the 100+ organisations involved, and take note of those in the space you’re interested in. You can also look at the IE Cambridge innovation report as well.\nAs an executive member of Cambridge University Entreprenurs (CUE) and Cambridge University Technology and Enterprise Club (CUTEC), I still find myself learning new things, so don’t be afraid if it seems overwhelming at first sight!\nAdvice to get started:\nAttend in-person and online events to network and discuss ideas. Make sure to join WhatsApp/Slack groups where much of the information is shared Join startup incubators (e.g. Kings Elab, Accelerate) or competitions (e.g. Oxbridge AI Challenge, Trinity Bradford Prize, college-specific ones like Fitzelerate) Consider joining society committees to lead events and meet like-minded people Example organisations by focus:\nHealthtech: MedTech Foundation, Building Bridges in Medical Science (BBMS), AI in Medicine PhD research spin-outs: Biospark, Maxwell Impulse Programme Final remarks Cambridge isn’t just about academic research - it’s the second-highest unicorns per capita globally, with investment growing rapidly. Over the coming decades, the university will increasingly position entrepreneurship as a core part of education.\n","permalink":"http://karthikprabhu.me/notes/cambridgeecosystem/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-it-matters\"\u003eWhy It Matters\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEducation has changed.

Over 6 weeks, you work directly with inventors and mentors through lectures and workshops, building practical skills in market research, strategy, and pitching.\nThough not as well-known as student-run groups (e.g. Cambridge Consulting Network), i-Teams stands out because it’s run by the university and offers direct collaboration with inventors. Sessions take place at the Institute for Manufacturing (IfM) which can be quite far, though online attendance is possible.\nOur project As part of Development i-Teams, I worked with mentor Clara Aranda-Jan and inventor Louise Allen on:\nDigiVis – clinically approved vision assessment technology DigiBel – clinically approved hearing assessment technology Our goal was to identify industries where these tools could generate revenue for future development. We explored applications across the NHS, schools, and opticians (e.g. Boots).\nWorkshops covered design thinking, market selection, and international development in collaboration with the Centre for Global Equality. We interviewed UK and international experts, synthesised findings, and presented our recommendations to Cambridge Enterprise and industry experts. (Details can’t be shared due to NDA.)\nFinal remarks If you’re interested in consulting, i-Teams is one of the best opportunities in Cambridge. Choose a project aligned with your interests (e.g. healthtech) and you’ll gain skills and experience that go well beyond the program.\nFor more detail on my syllabus, please click here\n","permalink":"http://karthikprabhu.me/projects/iteams/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"what-is-i-teams\"\u003eWhat is i-Teams?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://iteamsonline.org/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ei-Teams\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is a Cambridge consulting program where interdisciplinary teams of 7 (Master’s, PhDs, post-docs, MBAs, etc.) develop commercially viable strategies for emerging technologies.
